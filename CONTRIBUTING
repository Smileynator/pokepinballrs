Prerequisites
As much as we would love to take contributions of time and effort from anyone, the reality is that without technical knowledge about Assembly, Programming, and Hex Editing files, there is really not much you can add besides cheering from the sideline.
With that common question out of the way, let's talk contribution.
We make the assumption you know how to work github and a basic code project in your prefered IDE.

Decompilation
To decompile a function, simply decide on a single assembly function to decompile.
Go to decomp.me and create a new scratch, there should be a GBA preset for this game you can select.
Paste the assembly function, give the scratch the name of the function and add the context.
The context can either be added manually, or generated by using m2ctx.py
Note that m2ctx.py is vague about how to use it. In this project it means you need to put it straight into the Tools folder and nowhere else.
Some functions will contain named variables that decomp.me cannot figure out and will refuse to generate the scratch. To fix this, simply look up the value in the project and replace it with the hex value it represents.
Work your magic to decompile the code. Once done, you can put it back in your IDE.
